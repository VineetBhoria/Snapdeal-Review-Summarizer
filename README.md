Sentiment Analysis Using NLP
This project implements a simple Sentiment Analysis pipeline using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It aims to classify text data (e.g., reviews or tweets) into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The model is trained and evaluated using popular Python libraries.
